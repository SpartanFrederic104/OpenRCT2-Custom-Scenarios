# OpenRCT2-Custom-Scenarios

A repository containing all 450+ of my custom scenarios for OpenRCT2. They are divided into many custom campaigns/scenario packs, including but not limited to:

- **Tycoon Trek** — which takes inspiration from the original RollerCoaster Tycoon
- **Corkscrew Genesis** — an attempt to recapture the feeling of the Corkscrew Follies (Added Attractions) expansion pack for RCT1
- **Skyloop Splashdown** — arguably the biggest scenario pack in the collection, with a total of **69** playable scenarios. These scenarios are mainly based on those found in Loopy Landscapes
- **Butterfly Bash** — a scenario 20-pack which adds scenarios inspired by the original RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 scenarios
- **Camelback Chaos** — a scenario 35-pack which combines elements from various scenarios, including the original RCT2 scenarios and the famed VJ Scenario Pack
- **Wacky Worlds Redux** and **Time Twister Redux** — play through the RCT2 expansion scenarios again, but with various enhancements, new challenges, and a new coat of paint
- **Fred's Insanity: Part 1** — **WARNING: These scenarios are NOT for the faint of heart.**

Also included is a 999×999 workbench file containing every object from RCT2 and its expansions, as well as RCT1 and brand-new official objects introduced in OpenRCT2.
