# Fred-104's OpenRCT2 Custom Scenarios

A repository containing my custom scenarios for [OpenRCT2](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2). The scenarios are divided into many custom campaigns/scenario packs. See the **Currently Included Scenario Packs** section for more.

Also included is a 999×999 workbench file (Fred's Workbench.park) containing every object from RCT2 and its expansions, as well as RCT1 and brand-new official objects introduced in OpenRCT2.

# Currently Included Scenario Packs

- **Tycoon Trek** (32 scenarios) — which takes inspiration from the original RollerCoaster Tycoon.
- **Corkscrew Genesis** (46 scenarios) — an attempt to recapture the feeling of the Corkscrew Follies (Added Attractions) expansion pack for RCT1.
- **Skyloop Splashdown** (69 scenarios) — arguably the biggest scenario pack in the collection, prepare for a lengthy campaign based on the Loopy Landscapes expansion for RCT1.
- **Butterfly Bash** (20 scenarios) — adds scenarios inspired by the original RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 scenarios.
- **Camelback Chaos** (35 scenarios) — combines elements from various scenarios, including the original RCT2 scenarios and the famed VJ Scenario Pack.
- **Wacky Worlds Redux** (17 scenarios) — revisit the RCT2 Wacky Worlds scenarios with new challenges, various improvements, rides, scenery, and a new coat of paint.
- **Time Twister Redux** (14 scenarios) — return to Time Twister with new objectives, improvements, and rides, as well as a more modern visual makeover.
- **Coaster Impact** (14 scenarios) — every scenario has its own story to tell, but beware of massive spikes in difficulty as you progress through.
- **Fred's Insanity: Part 1** (29 scenarios) — **WARNING: These scenarios are extremely difficult and NOT for the faint of heart.**

# (IMPORTANT) REQUIREMENTS

The following requirements for being able to play through my scenarios are listed below:

- **Latest stable or develop build of OpenRCT2 (current: v0.4.6)** - This is important as the scenarios were made using OpenRCT2 itself Furthermore, most of the scenarios included are in the .park format, the new scenario/save format made exclusively for OpenRCT2 that drastically raises the limits from the original SC6 and SV6 formats.
- Both RCT2 Wacky Worlds and Time Twister expansion packs (many of the scenarios use assets from either expansion)
- RCT1 Deluxe linked to OpenRCT2 (expect RCT1 assets in use here too)
